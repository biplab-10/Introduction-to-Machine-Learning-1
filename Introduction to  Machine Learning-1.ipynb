    "Q2. What is supervised learning ? List some examples of supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "    Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm learns from labeled data \n",
    "    to make predictions or decisions. In this learning paradigm, the input data is accompanied by \n",
    "    corresponding output labels or target variables. The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs \n",

    "Q3. What is unsupervised learning? List some examples of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "     Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns patterns, \n",
    "     structures, or relationships in data without being provided with explicit labels or target \n",
    "     variables. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data and aims \n",

    "    Artificial Intelligence is a vast field and Machine Learning is a subset of AI and Deep Learning is subset of Machine Learning .\n",
    "    DS is the Art and Science of drawing actionable insights from the data. It is applied in most of the domains like Retail, Bank, E-Commerce, Healthcare and Telecom, etc.DS work with all ML,DL,RL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What are the main differences between supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "     Supervised learning is a problem with labeled data, expecting to develop predictive capability. Unsupervised learning is discovering process, diving into unlabeled data to capture hidden information. Semi-supervised learning is a blend of supervised and unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What is train, test and validation split? Explain the importance of each term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "    The train-test-validation split is fundamental in machine learning and data analysis, particularly during model development. It involves dividing a dataset into three subsets: training, testing, and validation.\n",
    "    The train-test-validation split helps assess how well a machine learning model will generalize to new, unseen data.\n",
    "    It also prevents overfitting, where a model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new instances.\n",
    "    By using a validation set, practitioners can iteratively adjust the modelâ€™s parameters to achieve better performance on unseen data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Importance of Train, Validation, and Test Split:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Generalization: The primary goal of machine learning is to build models that generalize well to new, unseen data. The train, validation, and test split ensures that the model is exposed to diverse examples during training, fine-tuning, and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Overfitting Detection: The validation set is crucial for detecting and preventing overfitting. If a model performs well on the training set but poorly on the validation set, it may be overfitting the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hyperparameter Tuning: The validation set is used for tuning hyperparameters, such as learning rates or regularization terms, to optimize the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Unbiased Evaluation: The test set provides an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance on completely new data, helping to estimate how well the model will perform in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "    By carefully managing the split between training, validation, and test sets, machine learning practitioners can develop models that are more likely to generalize well and perform effectively on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    " Q7. How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection?\n",
    "\n",
    " Ans:\n",
    "     \n",
    "    Unsupervised learning can be effectively used in anomaly detection, where the goal is to identify patterns or instances that deviate from the norm in a dataset. Anomaly detection is crucial in various fields such as cybersecurity, fraud detection, manufacturing, and healthcare. Here are several ways unsupervised learning can be applied to anomaly detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Clustering Techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "    K-Means Clustering: \n",
    "    K-Means can be used to group data points into clusters. Anomalies are often found in clusters with fewer data points or in data points that are far from the cluster centroids.\n",
    "    DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): DBSCAN can identify dense regions of data points and classify outliers as anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Autoencoders:\n",
    "    Autoencoders are a type of neural network that can be trained on unlabeled data to learn a compressed representation of the input. Anomalies can be detected by identifying data points that do not reconstruct well.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Isolation Forests:\n",
    "    Isolation Forests are a tree-based ensemble method designed for anomaly detection. They work by randomly partitioning the data until each instance is isolated. Anomalies are identified as instances that require fewer partitions to be isolated.\n",
    "\n",
    "    One-Class SVM (Support Vector Machine):\n",
    "    One-Class SVM is a type of SVM designed for binary classification where the majority of the data belongs to one class. It can be used to identify instances that deviate from the norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Statistical Methods:\n",
    "    Simple statistical methods such as z-scores or interquartile ranges can be applied to identify anomalies based on how far a data point deviates from the mean or median.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Density Estimation:\n",
    "    Techniques like kernel density estimation can be used to estimate the probability density function of the data. Anomalies are often associated with low probability regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Principal Component Analysis (PCA):\n",
    "    PCA can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Anomalies may be detected by identifying instances that do not conform to the dominant patterns in the reduced feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Local Outlier Factor (LOF):\n",
    "    LOF is a density-based algorithm that computes the local density deviation of a data point with respect to its neighbors. Points with significantly lower density are considered anomalies.\n",
    "    When applying unsupervised learning to anomaly detection, it's important to note that the definition of what constitutes an anomaly may vary across applications. Additionally, thorough evaluation of the chosen method on labeled data (if available) or through expert analysis is crucial to assess its performance and adjust parameters accordingly.\n",

    "\n",
    " Ans: \n",
    "      The most commonly used Supervised Learning algorithms are decision tree, logistic regression, linear regression, support vector machine.\n",
    "      The most commonly used Unsupervised Learning algorithms are k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and apriori algorithm.\n",
